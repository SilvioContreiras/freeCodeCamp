                    <p> Berners-Lee was born on 8 June 1955 in London, England,
                        the eldest of the four children of Mary Lee Woods and
                        Conway Berners-Lee; his brother Mike is an expert on
                        greenhouse gases. His parents were computer scientists
                        who worked on the first commercially built computer,
                        the Ferranti Mark 1. He attended Sheen Mount Primary
                        School, and then went on to attend south west London's
                        Emanuel School from 1969 to 1973, at the time a direct
                        grant grammar school, which became an independent school
                        in 1975. A keen trainspotter as a child, he learnt about
                        electronics from tinkering with a model railway. He
                        studied at The Queen's College, Oxford, from 1973 to
                        1976, where he received a first-class bachelor of arts
                        degree in physics. While at university, Berners-Lee made
                        a computer out of an old television set, which he bought
                        from a repair shop.
